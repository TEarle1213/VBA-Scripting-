# The VBA of Wall Street

Created VBA script to analyze stock data across three years. 
    Script loops through and aggregates data for each ticker, showing total volume, annual change and percentage change for each ticker, output to a summary table for each year.
    Script then finds highest and lowest performing stocks for each year and outputs to secondary table, allowing for end user to find this information at a glance.

Analysis of complete data set shows the most growth in overall market occured in 2018, at 466.85%. 2020 rallies back with a 381.39% increase after a net negative in 2019.    
The greatest increase in a single stock in one year occurs for RYU in 2019. The greatest single year decrease is RKS, also in 2019.
