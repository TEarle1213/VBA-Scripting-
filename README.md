# VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street

Created VBA script to analyze stock data across three years. 
    Script loops through and aggregates data for each ticker, showing total volume, annual change and percentage change for each ticker, output to a summary table for each year.
    Script then finds highest and lowest performing stocks for each year and outputs to secondary table, allowing for end user to find this information at a glance.

Analysis of complete data set shows the most growth in overall market occured in 2018, at 466.85%. 2020 rallies back from a net negative in 2019. Across all three years, the best performing stock was RYU, with a positive growth of 195.93%, and the worst performing stock was RKS, with an overall loss of 270.26%.
